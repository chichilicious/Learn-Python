# Learn-Python

Python is a very useful language to learn. Learning python can be very easy and I personally took very less time to learn it. This repository contains basic programs that I coded while learning python. Some of the files contain topic specific topics while the other contain a few basic Functions which are necessary.

This repository is work in progress. I will add comments and details to every file soon!

The books I referred to are: Python for Everybody, Exploring Data Using Python 3 by Charles R. Severance and Think Python by Allen Downey

I have created a short tutorial for Numpy. Try it out and explore it on your own!
